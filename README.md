It is time to make reptilian better...
Introducing lizardwizard.

Use the following in a terminal, on a computer that has Python installed.

```bash
# making sure you have python
python -V

pip install lizardwizard
```

Then use the `lw` command.

```bash
lw hello
```

You can use the `down` command to shut down reptilian without having to fiddle with the mouse integration -> ctrl -> ctrl+del -> mouse over shutdown -> click combo... dont do any of that anymore... simply say

```bash
lw down
```
